    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <p>I am Stephane Vanraes, a Bergen based developer specialized in Frontend solutions.</p>
    <p>When I am not hiking up some mountain, you might find me dabbling around with HTML, CSS and JavaScript at my computer trying to make lightweight, responsive and accessible websites.</p>
    <p>Over the years I have learned to appreciate SCSS for styling and Svelte for UI components, in fact this site itself is made using Svelte and Sapper).</p>
