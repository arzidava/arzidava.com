        <h2>Svelte Training</h2>
        <p>In the latest surveys concerning JavaScript libraries and frameworks, Svelte often comes up as a very anticipated package.  It promises easier development, faster rendering, smaller bundles and claims to be easier to learn as well.</p>
        <p>Naturally, it follows there is a surge in interest in learning Svelte, with blog post and guides in several places.  But sometimes it benefits to just have somebody come down and explain it to you, do some programming together and get hands on with the framework.</p>
        <p>That person could be me ðŸ’¡</p>
        <p>I have been using Svelte for three years (from v1, v2 and now v3) and gladly spread the word of this amazing framework.  If I come to your offices, you'll get a hands-on teaching approach covering the basics of the framework and more in 3 to 5 days.  Just contact me for more details.</p>
